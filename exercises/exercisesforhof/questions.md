Questions:
These are a few questions that you can solve using higher-order functions in OCaml:

1. Write a function `filter_map` that takes a list `l` and a function `f` that returns an optional value, and returns a new list containing only the non-`None` values returned by `f`.

2. Write a function `compose` that takes two functions `f` and `g` and returns a new function that applies `f` to the result of applying `g` to its argument.

3. Write a function `exists` that takes a list `l` and a predicate function `p`, and returns `true` if there exists an element in `l` for which `p` returns `true`, and `false` otherwise.

4. Write a function `iter2` that takes two lists `l1` and `l2` and a function `f`, and applies `f` to the corresponding elements of `l1` and `l2`. The function `f` takes two arguments, one from `l1` and one from `l2`.

5. Write a function `flatten` that takes a list of lists `l` and returns a flattened list containing all the elements of the sub-lists.
